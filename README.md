Analysis pipeline for generated TCR cdr3b structural modelling and evaluation

Search the [TCR3d Database](https://tcr3d.ibbr.umd.edu/mhc1_chains) for solved TCRâ€“pMHC structures corresponding to the generated epitopes and extract the associated PDB IDs.  
Run the TCR alpha and beta chains through [ANARCI](https://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/sabdab-sabpred/sabpred/anarci/) to identify V and J gene usage.
