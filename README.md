# TCRgen structure modelling
### AlphaFold 3 *recommended*
Follow installation on DeepMind's github [here](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3) to set up genetic databases.  
After, follow setup notebook in alphafold3/ to create input JSONs.  
Needlemen script can be found in [here](tcrdock/scripts/rmsd.ipynb) to align generated sequences to ground truth TCR structures.  
RMSD and interface analysis scripts can also be found [here](tcrdock/scripts/rmsd.ipynb)

### TCRDock
